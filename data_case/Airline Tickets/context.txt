Airfare Markets Under Pressure
Students in Data Science and Statistics
Introduction
Domestic air travel plays a vital role in economic connectivity, enabling business activity,
tourism, and personal travel across the United States. For consumers, airfare is one of the most
visible and variable costs of travel, shaped by factors such as distance, demand, airline
competition, and market concentration. Persistent fare differences across routes and cities raise
important questions about consumer welfare, pricing power, and market structure.
The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Domestic Airline Consumer Airfare Report provides
detailed, market-level data on fares, passenger volumes, and competitive dynamics across
domestic routes. Unlike anecdotal travel advice (e.g., “book on Tuesdays”), this data captures
systematic, structural drivers of airfare differences, offering an opportunity to rigorously analyze
how route characteristics and city-level market power relate to observed prices.
Challenge
To better understand the factors driving ticket affordability across domestic U.S. air travel, use
evidence-based insights that focus on market fundamentals such as competition, hub
dominance, route demand, and distance.
Using the provided dataset—constructed from U.S. Department of Transportation airfare
reports from 2021 to 2025 (Q2)—analyze when, where, and why airfares differ across markets,
and how city-level characteristics influence route-level prices. The ultimate goal is to translate
these findings into actionable insights that can inform travelers, industry stakeholders, and
policymakers.
Participants are encouraged to explore the dataset creatively. Possible analytical directions
include, but are not limited to:
1. Market structure and pricing: How do fares differ between routes that touch highly
dominant hub cities versus more competitive markets? Do routes with greater low-cost
carrier (LCC) penetration exhibit systematically lower fares?
2. Temporal and spatial patterns: How do average fares evolve across quarters and years?
Are fare changes uniform across markets, or concentrated in specific city-pairs or hubs?
3. Competition and affordability: How do dominant-carrier market share and lowest-fare
carrier presence relate to average market fares? Are students and budget-constrained
travelers more exposed to higher fares in certain city markets?
4. Modeling and prediction: Can route-level fares be predicted using distance, demand,
competition, and endpoint hub characteristics? Which features contribute most to
explaining fare variation across markets?
Usage
The results of this project have implications for a wide range of stakeholders. Consumers
benefit from clearer, evidence-based guidance on which routes and city markets tend to be more
or less affordable, enabling more informed travel decisions. Travel platforms and agencies can
leverage these insights to enhance pricing transparency tools, route comparisons, and
affordability indicators that improve user trust and decision-making. Airlines may use the
findings to evaluate their competitive positioning across markets and better understand how
hub dominance and low-cost carrier presence influence pricing strategies. Finally, policymakers
and consumer advocacy groups gain a data-driven perspective on airfare equity and
competition, supporting more informed discussions around accessibility, consumer protection,
and the fairness of domestic air travel markets.

Award Categories
● Best Overall Project
● Best Visualizations: Awarded to the team that produces the most insightful and visually
compelling representations of airfare dynamics, making complex relationships, like hub
dominance or competition effects, easy to understand.
● Best Insights: Recognizes teams that uncover the most actionable and meaningful
insights, especially those that challenge common myths or highlight structural
affordability barriers for students and families. Strong entries will move beyond surface
trends to explain why prices behave the way they do, whether due to airline strategy,
route competition, demand surges, or booking behavior. Findings that challenge
common myths or illuminate affordability barriers for students and families are
especially encouraged. The emphasis is on the clarity, originality, and real-world
usefulness of the insights, not just their statistical significance.
● Best Model: This prize goes to the team that develops the most accurate, reliable, and
innovative model for understanding or predicting airfare dynamics. Examples include
models that forecast ticket prices, identify the optimal booking window, or simulate
airline pricing strategies under different market conditions. Evaluation will focus on
technical rigor, creativity in feature engineering, and interpretability of results. Bonus
recognition will go to teams that translate their models into user-friendly tools or
recommendations that could help travelers make smarter, data-driven booking decisions.
